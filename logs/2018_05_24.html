Why he had attacked her father and was so hellbent on ending her life. However, it terrified the small child regardless. It terrified her that she was kicked across the tightrope of life and death from a merciless stab that just barely managed to reach her heart. By the same double-edged sword Cristan strutted it almost killed her. What stopped him was a man with black hair and red eyes with a mole, presumably the father. Rather than be pulled out this man attempted to end her by pulling this crystalized weapon along her back. Dragging it along her spine before being pulled out.<br><br>"RUN VA'KIN! HURRY!" And that she did, dragging and wall crawling with this scar running down her back. However, she was but a slow child. And in turn, after Cristan freed himself from this male he gave chase. To see the embodiment of the reaper so close and so determined in such an abrupt manner would shock anyone. And terrify those that were untrained. This memory followed her. The memory of being punted square in the skull by another ninja-like individual with enough force to damage her brain. She could not escape his presence. That he would eventually come back. That she needed to get stronger to get him back. To protect herself. In her mother's words... To survive. She tried to at the park... But Va'kin was too scared at the time. To weak to find an opening she could strike from. It angered her that she could only watch him walk away that day. All happy and carefree. Completely ignoring her...<br><br>But why was he here? Why was he with Fenrir? In this base?<br><br>[Everyone] Va'kin chose freedom. Security. Happiness. Permanent satisfaction. She could not escape by hiding behind her mother. By hiding behind Jiiro, Rey, Eterunetsu or her mother. Blank received his answer. She would toss all of it away. Abandon her own family and little humanity to be free. To do things of her own accord. To never be afraid again. There will always be enemies. There will always be really bad people. There was no safe haven. And if they can't or choose not to protect her then Va'kin would tread that terrifying tightrope again. She pushed her mother away and drew her sworf toward them all, ready to combat that them to keep them all away. She gave everything in her persuit to become <i>absolute</i>. That visible rage, that bed-shredding stance and flared wings from a result of stretching was a testimony. She will overcome this first trial.</span></div><br class="IC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[BlizzardStorm 11:14:09 PM]</span>( <b>BlizzardStorm: </b><span style="color: rgb(64, 128, 128);">MMMMMMMmm</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[BlizzardStorm 11:14:14 PM]</span>( <b>BlizzardStorm: </b><span style="color: rgb(64, 128, 128);">THE TYPOS BEGIN</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[Hiroshima 11:14:21 PM]</span>( <b>Hiroshima: </b><span style="color: rgb(255, 141, 0);">Fuck</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[MexiHaro 11:14:33 PM]</span>( <b>MexiHaro: </b><span style="color: rgb(146, 96, 153);">this bitch</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[BlizzardStorm 11:14:35 PM]</span>( <b>BlizzardStorm: </b><span style="color: rgb(64, 128, 128);">wooooooooooooow</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[MexiHaro 11:14:36 PM]</span>( <b>MexiHaro: </b><span style="color: rgb(146, 96, 153);">didnt mention rey</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[MexiHaro 11:14:40 PM]</span>( <b>MexiHaro: </b><span style="color: rgb(146, 96, 153);">fuck this shit im out</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[BlizzardStorm 11:14:41 PM]</span>( <b>BlizzardStorm: </b><span style="color: rgb(64, 128, 128);">how you gonna do me like that</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[Hiroshima 11:14:44 PM]</span>( <b>Hiroshima: </b><span style="color: rgb(255, 141, 0);">I did</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[BlizzardStorm 11:14:44 PM]</span>( <b>BlizzardStorm: </b><span style="color: rgb(64, 128, 128);">LOL</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[MexiHaro 11:14:48 PM]</span>( <b>MexiHaro: </b><span style="color: rgb(146, 96, 153);">I READ IT</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[MexiHaro 11:14:50 PM]</span>( <b>MexiHaro: </b><span style="color: rgb(146, 96, 153);">I READ IT</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="OOC message"><span class="timestamp">[Hiroshima 11:14:50 PM]</span>( <b>Hiroshima: </b><span style="color: rgb(255, 141, 0);">I sis mention rey tho</span> )</div><br class="OOC"><div class="IC say message" id="5978" style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span class="timestamp">[Hardex 11:14:55 PM]</span><img src="/faceicons/img_trans.gif" height="50" width="50" style="background-image: url(/faceicons/482.png);
