It is the source of her power and the enabler of her growth. Which must first come from the immunity to her pain uses cause. When open or revealed, the 'Clock Eye' ticks like grandfather clock in correlation to whatever timezone she is in. This aallows Mizore to know the exact time wherever she is.<br /><br />>Future Vision: The simplest and first ability Mizore's eye allows. Mizore is able see up to two month within in the immediate future. It is not omnipotent or expansive at the moment, however. She can only see the most probable future at the time of sight. Pain, on the other hand, comes not from the number of uses but the distances seen. Even just seeing a second into the future, which is entirely possible, causes headaches or migranes. Continuous strain through pain can cause death.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Mizore lacks recent memories but does recall many of her childhood and adolescence. This makes recalling her history somewhat difficult.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
