While she terrifies those that are easily susceptible to being frightened or intimidated by superiority, Jiiro expresses this presence in a terrifying manner that brings most pupils beneath her to a complete stop. She believes in wolves being fit to live if they are strong enough to survive on their own, and simply one day wants to confront someone who is on equal, if not, higher level than her that she can finally have the bliss in fighting things once again.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
