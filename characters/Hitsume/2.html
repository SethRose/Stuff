However, he does keep a sidearm somewhere on his person in addition to his hidden pack of cigarettes. He isn't seen as often in any of the scenes because of his background work and what he conducts to keep Fenrir operational, along with their assigned missions. While bearing some level of intelligence to have attained his rank to be higher than a captain's own, there's some levels of patience that he doesn't have that often you would find in others. There's not much else to be said about him.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
