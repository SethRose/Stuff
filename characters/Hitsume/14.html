These are sent out in small teams of three in order to combat and resist rank S monsters temporarily to provide more time to Fenrir soldiers to retreat or do other things. They're expendable units, just costly and must be deployed at a reasonable time. This model number is designated to be 'C145', in which most people refer to them as 'Chief' as a shorter name. Thus far, there are only ten operable Armored Suit Units, C145 included.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><center><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/bd/b5/d5/bdb5d5e867c9f10482dfefb1b957470b.jpg">
