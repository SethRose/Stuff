While she's popular within Fenrir and often called 'The Beast', she's actually only called that way because of things she's done out in the front lines beyond the dome and behind the lines as 'leisure time'. While one doesn't suggest to get intimate with her, there's some that do get into the interest of it and do end up regretting or loving it later. Aur, at first, gives off some kind of radiant and dark ambience around her while having golden wings that sprout from her back, but are able to make themself disappear as necessary.<br /><br />She is some kind of breed between angel and demon simultaneously, giving a rather strange appearance to those that've never seen hybrids before. While in combat, Aur is dedicated to bathing in the blood of her enemies, while in her leisure time, she dedicates herself as a whole to get to knowing others freely and enjoys seeing reactions and expressions of many. Aur is known to have some kind of monstrous strength and thirst for combat first above all else, and often separates from her main squad to enjoy a good killing.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
