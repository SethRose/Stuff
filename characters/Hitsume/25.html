Victoria is placed in as a Major General because of her esteemed courage and inability to become discouraged during planning for operations. She even goes out into the field as necessary if there is no one else capable to fill in a certain position. During one of the operations involving N, her platoon was nearly lost to three A-ranks, that were soon annihilated after quick improvised planning and timing, deeming many's respect for her to an immense degree for those who have been apart of Horizon long enough or been there to tell the tale personally.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
