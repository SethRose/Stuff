While she isn't exactly 'enthused' about working with Fenrir, she's simply working with them in order to lend aid to people who just need help with anything that isn't directly correlated with combat. Cass is the type of soldier who prefers not to fight, and understand a lot of things. So far, there isn't much for Fenrir to know about her other than her personal records. She is perceivably the most ordinary soldier there is in the ranks of Fenrir.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
