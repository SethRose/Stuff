With these powers, Raphael is capable of generating and manipulating a dark essence referred as the Ahriman Mist by Angra Mainyu worshipers. Its uncanny resemblance to shadows is what pegs this ability as a simple shadow manipulation. What one can do with this mist is up to the individual, for Raphael this mist mostly takes on properties that assists him with shadier practices.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Manifest] Daggers:</Font> Raphael condenses the Ahriman Mist to create his signature weapon. This blade cannot go over twelve inches in length.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Manifest] Bow:</Font> Creates a bow that generates arrows as the bowstring is pulled. This possesses the power of any normal bow.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Manifest] Ahriman Ritual Scythe:</Font> The signature technique of Angra Mainyu worshipers. Creates a large, pulsating scythe. This weapon stands out quite a bit from the rest as the blunt end of the blade is etched with red energy that reads out 'Purity' in avestan. While a scythe isn't the most efficient weapon to do combat with, it provides those capable with great power. When the Ritual Scythe claims a life, it will store the life essence of the slain. This life essence can then later be used in ritual to enhance the powers of a Angra Mainyu worshiper. Alternatively, the user may consume the life essence to heal their body and cure them of any ailment.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Emit] Shroud:</Font> Raphael conforms the ahriman mist to his body to turn him into a silhouette. While like this, he blends into dark environments and is much harder to spot. If an area is dark enough he may become completely invisible.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Emit] Dimmer:</Font> Conforms the ahriman mist to a room, darkening it depending on the size of the room. This is useless is large rooms.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Emit] Shadow:</Font> Raphael creates a silhouette clone of himself. This clone can not interact with the physical world and only serves as a distraction.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Enhance] True Sight:</Font> Grants Raphael enhanced vision in dark areas.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Ritual] Dark God's Feast:</Font> Raphael's ritual in which he offers the Life Essence of a slain foe to Angra Mainyu, enhancing his powers.<br /><br /><Font color="Silver">[Ritual] Dark Offering:</Font> A ritual in which Raphael burns material possessions or living creatures to please Angra Mainyu, thus continuing his bond to the dark god.</Font><br /><br /><br /><font color="Gray">By sacrificing the life essence to Angra Mainyu, Raphael is able to learn more techniques or increase the power of techniques he already knows. The increasing bond from sacrificing others to Angra Mainyu will also make the use of the Ahriman Mist easier on Raphael. If Raphael falls out of the dark god's favor, he can face severe punishments that may include death and dismemberment.</Font><br /><br /><u><b>.:|Skills|:.</u></b><br /><font color="Gray"><Font color="Silver">|Swordsmanship|</font><br /><font color=White>Raphael is highly skilled in the use of blades, relying on this skill of his the most for combat.
