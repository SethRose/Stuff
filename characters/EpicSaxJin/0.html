The auras he's capable of utilising are:<br /><br />Red Aura - Akahoshi possesses the Red Aura capability, otherwise known to him as Enhancement Aura. With this aura, he's capable of increasing their physical capabilities, but Akahoshi can take it a step further and increase certain properties of an object temporarily. He can do these things simultaneously. So far, in terms of increasing his own physical capabilities, he can go up to Peak Human (for a grown man), as for his senses, they can go to superhuman levels.<br /><br />Yellow Aura - Akahoshi possesses the Yellow Aura capability, otherwise known as the Construction Aura to him. With it, he's capable of creating solid constructs with said aura and can control said constructs. It can also be utilised for Ergokinetic Combat or to create an Energetic Pressure. A bonus of this aura is that the user possesses a strong force of will. So far, in terms of his construction capabilities, he's only capable of creating up to human sized objects and if it's a weapon, it has to follow the Gun Regulation List.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Having been born within what could be considered the least well known criminal family and ex-stealth corps family, Akahoshi had to learn the ropes from both sides, but mostly from his criminal counterpart- the Vang Family. He was to know where he's allowed to go to and where he isn't allowed to go to, which families, businesses and establishments were to be respected- and to pretty much keep his mouth shut all times and to do what he's told. Even with all that said, he likes to cause some trouble for people for some reason. Like, sometimes small problems, and sometimes -BIG- problems. <s>Edgy little shit</s>.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />*Notable Skills - Quick Learner, Spearmanship (2/5), swordsmanship (5/5), Gunmanship (2/5), Stealth (4/5), Acrobatics/Free-Running (5/5), <s>Roast</s>Taunt (6/5), Hand-To-Hand (2/5), Singing (-1/5)<br /><br />Likes: Rock, Heavy Metal, Hip Hop, edgy music.
