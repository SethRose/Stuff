Along side this, the rest of her body is only slightly more durable than a normal humans. But the true part of her power, is that she is very hard to actually take out of a fight. No matter how much severe damage gets done to her body, she can just keep going, even achieving feats that should be impossible, like continuing to function with both lungs ruined. Obviously, this only extends so far and as such if she were to lose most of her muscle mass on a limb, it would become nearly entirely useless. The strength of her bones means her skull is extremely durable and practically even bullet proof, but assuming someone did destroy her brain she would die.<br /><br />Backfire - Hetza can unleash superhuman levels of strength from her limbs but doesn't gain the resistance usually associated with such a feat. The more strength she uses, the more likely she is to end up destroying her own limbs in the process.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />---<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
