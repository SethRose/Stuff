Her true ability manifests itself as a set of large golden doors that can be summoned that lead to her own small dimension. Nothing from within can exit the gate but nothing can be permanently destroyed in there either. It is the ultimate sanctuary and training ground, filled with creatures and monsters under Kateph's control.<br /><br />Avatar - Kateph usually has enhanced durability and peak human strength. However, she can summon her gate but instead of it leading to her dimension, it opens into seemingly nothing but a black abyss. This actually acts as a gateway of power for Kateph instead. It increases her durability to superhuman levels and her strength to enhanced, allowing her to also grow to about 10 feet tall and gain another set of arms. The drawback is that the gate can be destroyed much easier than she can with her new durability and the backlash would render her instantly unconscious.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Kateph was born as a humanoid jackal to human parents and her birth was seen as a dark omen, the coming of the God of Death. She was sent immediately to a temple to be raised by priests of that dark god and to learn her new role as the vessel of a God's power. As she grew older, she became increasingly aware of the fear and terror in the eyes of everyone that looked upon her. They would flee from her, avoid her, even the priests tried to have as little to do with her as possible. But with that fear came power. Kateph was given anything she wanted, whenever she wanted it and as her powers began to manifest they only grew more fearful and more willing to do as she asked. She had tribute given to her, gold trinkets and just about everything of value the people had. She made them bow before her and build great structures that served no purpose but to prove her power over them. This last for many years and soon the burden on the people was too great, their wealth stolen, loved ones lost in the construction of buildings that served no purpose at all and endless amounts of food given in tribute that left the people near starvation. Kateph failed to see this, spending most of her time in her decadent temple, but she probably wouldn't have cared even if she had. These people lived to serve her, that was their place in this life.<br /><br />These thoughts would be her downfall. People left the village to seek out any help they could find, any method of being rid of this foul monster that now ruled over them. It took years but finally one of them returned with a simple, humble looking old man. He came from a village filled with prosperity and where the people lived long lives thanks to his gifts. He vowed to use those gifts to save the people from their terrible ruler. HE devised a plan, to lure her from her temple and the safety of it's walls and guards. Then, they would strike her down before she could summon her powers and bury her in a tomb, sealing her with his magic for all eternity, for they could not expect to kill an avatar of a god. And so they enacted their plan, luring Kateph from her temple to one of the structures she had built. There, they dropped a large boulder onto her, sending her crashing to the ground with a sickening crack. She was not terribly injured, but she was knocked unconscious. The villagers took their chance, binding her in blessed bandages that would seal her evil powers and then placing her in a stone coffin. They then sealed the tomb, the old man sacrificing ten volunteers to fuel his magic seal on the tomb and thus ensure she never escaped.<br /><br />However, Kateph was no god, nor even an avatar of one. She was merely born to a strange body with strange powers. The bandages were nothing but water soaked bits of cloth with prayers spoken over them, they could not hold her. But the seal on the tomb did trap her inside in a state of unconsciousness, with the unintended effect of keeping her in a kind of stasis that was the only reason she didn't die naturally from hunger, thirst or old age. They unintentionally ensured she would never die in that tomb, and as hundreds then thousands of years passed the seal grew weaker. Kateph awoke suddenly within her stone tomb and with a shout of rage she threw open the coffin and emerged into the ruins of her tomb. She stepped outside to find her small kingdom ruined, sunken beneath the sand. Everything had been stolen from her, nothing remained. Kateph spent her first day searching for anything that remained of her people, but there was nothing. Soon, she had no choice but to move on, hungry and thirsty, feelings she had never felt in her previous life. She entered into a world entirely different from the one she had left behind. It took her a long time just to adapt to the language and the culture and most of all, to being a nobody, a nothing. She still saw the fear in their eyes, but it was different. She soon discovered why, when she ended up on her way to a city sealed away from the rest of the world. She felt her anger welling up inside of her. She had traded but one tomb for another.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
