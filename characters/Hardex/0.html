She has extremely tough scales, making her quite difficult to cut or stab deeply with ordinary knives or similar weapons. She also has strong bones that allow her to take pretty intense blunt force trauma without breaking bones. Along side this she ha dense muscles that absorb the shock of such impacts to protect her organs but also providing her with enhanced strength. She can breath under water and is extremely fast in the water as well, though her powerful muscles make her fast on land as well. Finally, she has razor sharp teeth in powerful jaws, capable of even biting into metal though that would hurt and has an extremely powerful sense of smell on land that is even stronger in the water.<br />(Enhanced Durability vs shooting, cutting, stabbing. Near Superhuman against blunt force)<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Not even she remembers her history, it may never be known.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
