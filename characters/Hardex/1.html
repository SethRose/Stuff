This means for example a knife could cut into metal when charged or a baseball bat would have an extremely powerful swing. It would also apply to something like a bicycle  for example, allowing it to be much faster than normal.<br /><br />A Good Workman - Tori can instead or also use her ability to increase her own physical abilities, improving her strength to superhuman levels while adjusting her durability to counteract the damage she would normaly do to herself, heightening her senses significantly or even to increase her natural rate of healing. When unconscious or seriously injured, her body does that last option automatically. The drawback of the power is that it also accelerates the body, eating up energy in the form of calories at a massive rate. This means that overuse can do lasting damage to her body if she starts losing fat and muscle tissue to provide the required energy, it also leaves her with quite the appetite. It also boosts blood flow, meaning even minor bleeding injuries can lead to serious issues with blood loss because the blood has no time to clot.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />To Be Revealed<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
