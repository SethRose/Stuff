With just a snap, he can open something. A door? He can open that. A window? That too. A locked safe? Yup. The logistics of the power are a bit more complex, however. Although currently, his control over the power only streches as far as those examples, it can be used more creatively. The overall concept is that if he can perceive a 'closed' state of something, and a 'open' state of something, then he can transition from 'closed' to 'open' but not the reverse. Simply put, if he were to see a wall as obstructing, or 'closing' off his path, then he could 'open' a hole in it to allow passage. A bit more of a radical example, although far out of reach for what he can currently do, Daniel could use the phrase 'open-heart surgery' to help perceive a 'closed' and 'open' state for something's chest. <br /><br /><u>Pathmancy</u><br />'Pathmancy', a work in progress name, is Daniel's second ability, though currently far more useful. It's also a lot more simple, and is basically just a portal. There isn't really a trigger so much as he just wills it. The power allows him to link one entry, which is what he uses Open Sesame on, to another exit. The 'exit' has to be somewhere he's been before, though. So he could open a door or window at school with Open Sesame, go through it, and end up at his main entrance at home, or even the bathroom window.<br /><br /><b><u>Trivia</u></b><br /><br /><b><u>History</u></b><br />Relatively normal college student, there isn't really much to say about him. He's aware that thanks to his power he could probably do something productive but... Just hasn't felt the need to.
