Her strain of vampirism focuses on her regenerative ability, quickly closing wounds and restoring severed body parts. Even if her body is reduced to gibs it will eventually put itself back together, as long as the parts arent burned. This process can be sped up with the presence of blood, being possible as long as there are still parts of her that have not been reduced to ashes. Her physiology provides her with massive pain resistance, as most wounds have no impact, however it also makes her exceedingly vulnerable to certain properties. Among them are most notably holy properties and things that use the power of the sun, not only causing her severely intensified pain but also being an effective means of harming and killing her. Silver, among other things, also has such impact, but less prominent. Despite this her regenerative abilities allow her to withstand the normal incidence of the sun, as long as she has fed recently and sticks to the shade, otherwise it causes growing burns until her body begins to pulverize.<br /><br />Besides that her physical attributes are enhanced to a certain degree, not nearly to the same extent as vampiric strains and other powers that focus on such abilities, also varying depending on her blood intake. When deprived of blood she will have nearly human capabilities. Her senses are also notably sharpened, as common for all vampires, particularly being able to detect heartbeat, night vision, improved scent and hearing.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Gaining her powers was a rough patch for Naira, as she had was struck with a constant thirst for blood she had a really hard time containing. She found herself unable to resist the urges most of the time, leaving a trail of violence in her wake. As time passed she became more acquainted with her powers, and eventually learned to control herself, and finally reduce her blood intake to just what was necessary. To make up for what she had done she decided to join an organization where her powers could shine the best, perfectly suited infact, as she could shed her blood to pay for what she consumed. As such she joined Onward, making use of her natural resilience against dying.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
