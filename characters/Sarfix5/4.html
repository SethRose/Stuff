The strings know no friend nor foe as they can cut any person. The user is even able to be cut by the strings, but only if they allow the strings to do so. The strings can be attached to people (with permission) and deceased bodies in order to make them act as though they were moving normally. The strings can be run through the body and act as stitching for external and internal body injuries, allowing them to sow up a wound or whatever.<br /><br />String Type Two<br />This second type of string is an extension of the first type of string. This allows the user to do two additional things. <br /><br /><i>Thirst</i><br />The first thing is that the strings are able to consume any blood that comes in contact with the strings, this automatically causes the person's blood that came in contact with the string to be a target. People who become targets automatically have a lowered defense against the strings and are thus, more at risk of getting cut up. The only way to make a person a target for the Thirst to start is for the user to flick a finger at the target and have a piece of string shoot off and pierce the target's body.

It allows the strings to not only connect body parts back together, it also allows for restoration of parts that cannot be normally sown back, such as the eyes, tendons, and muscles to an extent. 2 Post CD; 3 Post For Completion<br /><br />Mana Usage<br />15 MP For 3 posts<br /><br /><i>Latching Onto You</i><br />The strings that are set up are able to connect with and cut immaterial or ethereal  objects that can not be touched by the human hand such as clouds, light, and etc. However, this can only be on for a certain amount of time. 3 Post Duration; 3 Post CD<br /><br />Mana Usage<br />20 MP For 3 Posts<br /><br />Cutting Ability:<br />Garrote Wire Cutting Ability [0 MP Used]<br /><br />Ability to pierce Flesh easily [10 MP For Each Post]<br /><br />Ability to cleave through bodies [20 MP For Each Post]<br /><br />Ability to cut through stone [30 MP For Each Post]<br /><br />Ability to cut through steel [40 MP For Each Post]<br /><br />Recovery<br />Each Post in which Kushina is not using her ability, she gains 25 MP back<br /><br />Mana Points<br />This is basically a gauge that helps to maintain how frequent a mutant is able to use their power.
