His father was black and his mother was a white Jewish woman. He had some peaceful years, however, during this time, mutants were already being transported into the dome by WORLD. His mother and father were a bit fearful as to let him go inside of the dome due to the fears of an event that had happened years ago in the start of the second world war. They kept him, homeschooling him and all. They made sure he was kept from being too emotional so as to not release his abilities. Leon managed to understand that in his later ages and managed to keep his cool, though it was difficult, as everyday life can be a burden even on a non-mutant. It was during his teen years that he was allowed to go to school with other people. He blended in perfectly, well, except for the white hair on a black guy, some young Morgan Freeman shi-<br /><br />Leon's years at the high school went a bit smoothly, however, he had already taken notice of a few incidences where mutants were found out in the school and were promptly taken away, never to be seen again. Most kids gossiped that they were killed or taken far away to a place called 'N'. This struck fear into Leon which caused him to reduce his social output. However, there was one boy that he knew that he was very close with. He still didn't reveal to him that he was mutant for fear on what would happen, though the boy was passionate towards mutants and didn't see them to be that much trouble. As they grew closer, the boy, who's name was Walter, managed to find out just by being with him and growing to understand him. Leon didn't realize this and there was an incident one day during school. One day, there were a three kids who were bullying Leon for not being social towards the other students. They began to call him mutant for fun as only mutants would act that way. Leon got involved into a altercation with one of the boys just as Walter came around the corner, as soon as the three boys were beating on Leon, he snapped, releasing a rune large enough to encompass not only the four of them, but to reach close to Walter, who was coming from class. The rune swept up wind and combined with fire before emitting an explosion that injures the three boys horribly. Ryuzen calmed down only to see what he had caused and nearly freaked before being called to by Walter, who had seen. Ryuzen nearly runs but is held still by him. He tells Ryuzen that he had figured it out some time ago with his 'Master Deduction Skills'. After this, Ryuzen and Walter attempt to wake up the boys, who don't for a while. They leave them after a little bit and go their separate ways. The boys wake up and don't remember the ordeal, only Ryuzen screaming.<br /><br />Ryuzen and Walter go to school the next day just to see military police in the school, looking for one student in particular. Ryuzen naturally began to freak while Walter bit his own tongue before pushing Ryuzen to get him to shut up. When Ryuzen does so, the military police catch sight of Ryuzen and push other students away before grabbing him. He removed his helmet in order to show his face, it turned out to be a man that his father knew some years back. His eyes were filled with sorrow as he whispers into Ryuzen's ear what had happened not too long after he had left his parent's house. Military police had been called to their home on suspicion of them being mutants, it turns out that his mother was a mutant and his father was hiding her for years now. They were discovered soon after a terrorist event shook their state that involved four mutants. His father attempted to stop them from arresting his mother and was promptly shot twice in the chest, killing him. His mother was shocked and released her own ability due to grief. She releases a large energy that caused the men to convulse when it came in contact with them before killing them. As soon as the men inside the house had died, it didn't take long for other military police to come after the house. She was shot in the chest, he didn't even know where the bullet had come from. As she fell on her knees, the last words he heard from her was, 'My baby. . .'<br /><br />After hearing this, Ryuzen nearly collapsed from shock, however, the other military police took notice of one of their own talking with Ryuzen before coming up to him. They start to press him with questions which further break into Ryuzen's psyche, this continues before one of the students he had injured earlier comes out from a classroom and shouts while pointing at Ryuzen. This causes Ryuzen to freak out beyond belief again as a rune that encompasses the entire squad of military police is created. The police raise their guns only to be hit with an explosion as soon as the rune was created. The bomb obliterates most of the police and destroys the structure of the school. The explosion created a cloud of smoke that blinded most people. When the smoke and everything cleared, the school started to fall apart as well, collapsing on itself. When it all collapses, Leon's eyes manage to flutter as he looks around, only seeing smoke and broken bodies from students. He attempted to get up but felt a pain in his leg as debris had fallen on him. His friend Walter was still but wakes up after some major prodding by Leon. He manages to drag both himself and Walter away from the destroyed school just as more Military Police arrive. They arrive at Walter's home before collapsing into sleep, letting their bodies rest until they could make a way to leave.<br /><br /><br />Time Skip<br /><br /><br />Leon was seventeen and was still on the run with Walter, who was also considered an accomplice with Leon that caused the school bombing. They had traveled towards a few states in order to find a way to settle down, having met both the best and worst types of people. The ones who show compassion to mutants and those who believe that mutants are the scum of the earth, even worse, Leon was black, making matters a bit worse. They one day had a fateful encounter with three people who turned out to be mutants blending into society. They didn't want to go towards where they were taking the mutants as they believed it was a place they would die horrifically. They were a bit kind to Leon but directed contempt towards Walter as he was a non-mutant. This went on for a bit but they allowed them to stay with them for the meanwhile. Leon didn't know that these people were actually part of a terrorist group that was known for assassinations and bombings in protest to mutants being shipped. It was filled with mutants mainly who used their abilities in public to fight against military police. Leon and Walter managed to discover this by accident and were promptly held prisoner in the house for a few months before being allowed to know more of their group. Leon was let in easily while they were more hard on Walter for him not being a mutant, though after some time they allowed him in as well. It was more or less a forced recruitment and they both agreed that they would escape the first chance they got. This became hard however as they were watched like vultures watching dying animals. They learned the way of combat with their hands and with their abilities, they also passed the time by trainers while befriending some of the other mutants. They eventually were forced to run through missions with other mutants to prove loyalty in order to keep their right to live. These missions involved bombings, kidnappings, assassinations, bribing, extortion and other nefarious crimes across several states. <br /><br /><br />The crimes took to their peak when at one point, they were told that the governor of a state had been causing trouble for them despite being one of their own informants and was to be executed immediately. The duo managed to make this point when they would bail from the group. They were paired with five other people as they were sent. It was during the afternoon and the governor was driving through in his car in order to help boost his chances of getting re-elected. As soon as the other members of the group went to go prepare, Walter and Leon prepare to bolt from the area. The governor suddenly drives up to them and rolls down his window, he asks them if they would vote for him while grinning. Leon speaks awkwardly while Walter replies to him, Leon looks from the corner of his eyes just to see one of the mutants he was with point a finger a the car the governor was driving in and flicks it off, as if firing off something. The car would suddenly explode in a cloud of red smoke, Leon and Walter are sent flying as they hear screaming. Leon slowly sat up and looks around for the member before hearing the woman again, this time she was pointing at him and Walter, shouting accusations. This prompted other people to follow as they began to throw stuff at them both, ranging from plastic bottles to glass bottles and bricks. Walter shields his own face but gets pelted, as well as Leon. Leon's anger reaches it's point when one brick smacks into Walter's jaw and knocks it loose, Leon stretches out his hand as a fire rune expelled from his hand, only to expel flames at the people, burning them as others ran. Leon then attempted to pick up Walter but catches sight of Military Police coming while Walter shoves him, speaking through a broken jaw, telling him to run. Leon hesitates before running/limping through an alleyway to escape the police.<br /><br />A few months later<br /><br />Leon had turned to robbing and breaking into homes in order to survive, having been beaten multiple times, nearly killed by other illegal mutants, having killed two innocents, he was a mess. He needed a way to stay away from other mutants and not attract attention as he was at that point one of the most wanted for killing a governor and being responsible for the multiple terrorist attacks, he usually applied hair dye and makeup to his face in order to avoid detection. He usually lived in broken down homes in order to avoid trouble that he didn't need. He never was able to find Walter after that incident. He used his abilities whenever need be and managed to teach himself more literature and the languages of Spanish fully and French halfway. There was one day when he was out on the street, having stolen some semi new clothes before seeing a grey SUV driving around. He didn't bother and didn't freak out while walking as he usually did, but suddenly, the SUV stops in front of him, people come out quickly with guns and grab him before stuffing him into the car. They held a gun to his temple while they blindfolded him and gagged him, they drove for a few hours before he hears footsteps and men talking about how much cash 'it' would bring. <br /><br /><br />He struggled before he is struck on the back of the head with a blunt object and fell unconscious. He wakes up hours later to hear the sound of a plane turning but is still blindfolded. He moved a bit only to fall from somewhere and hears voices, he is struck on the back of the head again and falls unconscious. He hears somebody shout his name before his vision went black. He wakes up hours later again to find himself in a plane along with ten other people. He wasn't blindfolded and looks around, only to see Walter in the plane with him, except Walter's face was a mess, having jagged cuts along his face along with a small hole on the side of his face. Before he could speak with him, they would land somewhere and the plane opens to reveal soldiers with assault rifles pointed at them as they escort them out, pelting them with insults about them being mutant scum, scum of the earth, bastardized monsters. They could only see a large mist in the front of them as they as forced straight into a large mist that was not too far in front of them. They are handcuffed to each other as they are given ten seconds before the soldiers would open fire on them to kill them. As soon as they say one, they all sprint into the mist, not knowing most of them would be killed horrifically.<br /><br /><br />As they all ran into the mist, they didn't stop for fear they would be shot. However, after a while, they all stop and look around, not seeing anything except fog around them. They stop and attempt to remove their handcuffs, Leon uses the opportunity to talk with Walter as they do so, Walter was very surprised to see him as he thought he had been killed some time ago. His lack of faith had crushed Leon a little as they all managed to remove their cuffs. They introduce themselves and tell each other of their abilities, the rest of the group are a bit shocked when Leon tells them his name and point out that he was famous for the school explosion, terrorist attacks, and assassination of the governor. Though they were skeptical on whether or not he was telling the truth, they don't pry and continue to traverse the mist. They travel for about five days, not seeing anything other than strange animals that run away when they see them. At one point, they see something dart around in front of them, one of them freaks and releases a shock wave that shakes the environment, making a loud-ass noise that spreads through the mist. They don't hear anything and continue going before they hear a 'SHINK!' and turn around, only to see the guy that had released the shock wave impaled to a tree by his head, a rather large spike coming from his head. This causes fear amongst the group as they dash forward, but they see a large scorpion with a stinger that started to grow back in front of them. Walter jumps back when the scorpion moves a claw forward to grab him before being hit by an arrow made of pure light from another of the group. The scorpion hisses and charges at them all, Leon thrusts a hand out and a rune forms that releases a torrent of flames towards the scorpion. It attempts to dodge but it is held still as one of the group places their hands on the ground and causes the ground under the scorpion to become sticky and traps it. The fire burns the scorpion as it writhes before it finally dies. They all look at one of their dead comrade before continuing on. The rest of the group finds out that Walter was thrown in with them despite being a non-mutant for helping Ryuzen kill the governor. Walter's eyes held a dead look in them that didn't cease. <br /><br /><br />As they continued, they encountered more creatures that attacked them but ran most of the time from them. They were losing morale and began to think that they would eventually die there as they continued. One day, contempt began to breed against the eldest in their group and Walter as Walter was ultimately useless in the situation, this continued and the group came in to stop them before hearing a high pitched voice screeching. They all stop and look around before they see an explosion erupt not too far from them. They all turn tail and run before an explosion erupts in the middle of the group and kills one of their own. The surviving members stand together while they look for the enemy. They catch sight of the attacker and are surprised to see two masked men approaching them. One was a quite large man while the other was a man of regular build. The smaller man begins to tell them that they were within sacred ground and that the death of their member was the cost of their trespassing. The leader of the group grits his teeth before drawing his hands as if he were drawing a bow before a bow and arrow made from pure light forms into his hands. He fires an arrow at the bigger man and is astonished when the big man vanishes and appears beside him, only to strike him with his right arm that ignites and emits a powerful explosion that destroys most of his body, killing him minutes after. The rest of the group charges them, only four of them being left as Leon creates runes that stack both fire and rock in order to create lava as he launches lava rocks at the duo. The large man manages to avoid each rock that is thrown before his feet are sunk into the ground by one of the members. The lava rock collides with him and burns him horribly, melting his skin and killing him. They move towards the smaller man before he brings out a sword and slashes at them, despite them being several feet away from him. Ryuzen was reaching for his own neck to scratch it before he feels a sharp pain in his wrist. He looks at it, only to see that his right hand was cut clean off of his body. He then feels two more slashes on his chest and back before he collapses onto the grass. He could barely move and struggles to look up as he sees Walter shouting and charging at the masked man. Ryuzen's eyes widen as the masked man dashed forward and strikes Walter's stomach, only for a hole to be blown through his stomach that exits from his back. Walter is shocked and falls on his knees, not able to move as he looks at Ryuzen with the last of his energy and says, 'F-Fuck man. . .w-we fucked up, didn't we?'<br /><br /><br />Walter falls over, dead, Leon could barely keep his eyes open as he hears the shouts of his other comrades being cut down one by one. He then hears gunfire come from somewhere as several shouts are also heard. He spots what looked like soldiers in light armor as they fire at the masked man. He attempts to move but fails to do so, though he grabs the attention of one of the soldiers, who rushes forward and pulls him in. He puts him on his back and starts to head back for the truck, he sees the masked man being shot at but held his hand out, a large explosion emitting from his hand to repel the bullets back at the soldiers. Several soldiers are killed before they are forced to retreat, Leon then lost consciousness as a result from the blood loss, not seeing any of his group on the truck.<br /><br /><br />Fast Forward<br />Leon was taken into Taikoku, where he was treated for his injuries and was told upon waking up to explain how he got there. He ends up crying on realization of what had happened before, he explains everything by saying he was a mutant trying to live a peaceful life and ended up getting caught and thrown into the mist. He was given a mechanical glove as a replacement for his right hand and was allowed to stay. He conformed to the ritualistic attitude of the city as he lived in the slums, steadily working and regularly joining in on expeditions to help find resources. He has spent two years in the city already but was already thinking about much, about the group that apparently betrayed him, the people that apparently sold him here, and about how the world really was this out of sync.<br /><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/382202108&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><br /><br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
