As a result of the incident, his mind created a separate personality in order to cope with the world, Somebody and Nobody. Somebody and Nobody each have their respective skills that can be used at will by themselves. However, it is mainly recommended that they only use their abilities that apply to each personality as using them when they're the other personality attracts consequences.<br /><br /><u>Nobody</u><br /><i>Mask</i><br />Nobody is able to transfer his energy into his body and change his appearance, this is quite a simple thing, however, he will only be able to turn into the person after he has touched their bodily fluid for a living person. He is also able to copy the appearance of a deceased being by touching their body only. As for the bodily fluid, when he comes in contact with it, he will be able to copy everything physical from the person. Though Tim will only be able to copy what they currently look like, his transformation won't change if the target's physical appearance changes, forcing him to have to come in contact with their bodily fluid again. This technique is mainly for Nobody and can cause bad side effects if used with Somebody which include vomiting, dry heaving, and wheezing.<br /><br /><i>Those masks are for no one, you are still someone, and for someone, those masks are as good as poison.</i><br />- Nameless<br /><br /><i>Dog</i><br />Nobody is able to manifest his energy into the form of three dogs, those three dogs in actuality are all Nobody in another physical form. These three dogs have their own strengths and weaknesses which are empowered due to the energy being imbued within them. They do not require energy in order to be kept around in manifestation.<br /><br />Bloodhound<br />Heightened Sense of Smell<br />Good Tracker<br />Lazy<br /><br />German Shepherd<br />Able to use coordination, which allows the dogs to move in sync and get a slight boost in speed, strength, size, and bite<br />Increased Running Speed<br />Able to predict movements to some extent<br /><br />Dogo Argentino<br />High Tolerance to pain<br />Increased Strength<br />Increased Bite<br /><br /><u>Somebody</u><br /><i>Bloodlust</i><br />Somebody is able to converge energy into his entire body in order to bring about blood lust. This causes him to focus on his target while moving at a higher speed. The most notable thing about this is his increase in quickness, allowing him to perform small actions in a seeming blur. He is able to release a large wave of energy that imposes a suppressed feeling as he releases blood lust onto either his target or multiple people in the vicinity. While focusing on a target, he will be able to follow them purely on their smell, in his own vision, the smell will leave a trail for him to find. His target's path will automatically become different from other people's path, as to stop confusion. This ability is primarily for Somebody and the use of it by any other than Somebody will result in the user regurgitating blood at one point.<br /><br />Power 2<br />Charge Attack<br />This allows Timothy to be able to add energy to his attacks, strengthening them in order to perform actions with much more effect than they would originally have had.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=white><br />During his life as a young child, he witnessed the rape and murder of his cousins while in their home. It was evident that he was hiding and could only watch from a distance in a hiding place as intruders allowed dogs to kill and devour his relatives. The entire event left a severe mental scar that did not allow him to cope in life so his body automatically created a second personality within his own body. He is able to become his other personality whenever he chooses, as shown by his natural brown eyes obtaining a tint of red. While being inside, he met new people and learned to cope with his surroundings, however, the one thing that remains as far as safety goes is curiosity, curiosity with the world of N before the city. <br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/42018086&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><br /><br />
