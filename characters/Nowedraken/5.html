As expected because of this her physiology is that of a demons, granting her greantly enhanced strength, speed and durability, along with heighted stamina reserves. Her sight, hearing and smell are also much keener than a humans Suffice to say, she is a keen hunter and can take a hell of a beating while also dishing one out, in a straight up fist fight. Lilith's true power however stems from the supernatural ability her demonic blood affords her, and this is a natural connection to one of the worlds natural elements lightning. Through this connection Lilith can freely control and create lightning using her own demonic energy, while this naturally manifests in appearance as what one would expect of a natural lighting, Lilith can also access a much more powerful form of this power by infusing her demonic energy into the element rather than using it purely as the fuel. When this happens the lighting takes on a near pitch black color with a light purple hue as an outline, and gains nearly three times the speed and destructive force, though use of this can be exhausting. Another benefit to this is her ability to absorb outside sources of near any form of electricity, that is not her own, to restore her demonic energies and stamina, while also healing her to some degree, the greatest effect coming from the absorbtion of natural lightning.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />(This is optional.)<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
