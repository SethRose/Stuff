It was found that this power was the result of a genetic mutation which allowed her to project mental energy in a variety of ways, though the limits of her power are unknown, she herself is not capable of controlling them completely. After her powers where discovered Pandora was subjected to years of genetic alteration and several other experiments on her mind. The end result greatly amplified her telekinetic power well beyond her years. However the downside to this seemed to give her power a sort of personality all it's own, which seems to have a much stronger control over Pandora, able to manipulate even her own thoughts.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />(This is optional.)<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
