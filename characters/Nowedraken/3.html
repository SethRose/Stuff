She no longer actually needs them, her sight having naturally corrected over time. However she always liked the look and thus wears them more for asthetic now.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>Powers/Abilities:</u><font color=yellow><br /><u>Human/Fire God hybrid physiology</u><br />Ayana possesses a mixed physiology which grants her the powers one would expect of a fire god, though presents her with the weaknesses of a human. Do to her mixed blood Ayana's flame isn't pure and as a result holds a green tint to it unlike the usual blue or yellow flame. While Ayana is capable of creating and controlling her own unique green flame, she doesn't possess the same natural gift for it that a natural born fire god would, requiring her to practice. The limitations mentally and physically also hinder her abilities to an extent, as she can often lose control of her powers when emotional or force to endure extreme bouts of extented training or combat, leading to exhaustion both mentally and physically. However her fire god heritage does grant her a strong and more durable body than that of any normal human, allowing her to reach peak human in virtually all physical aspects under normal conditions, though she can briefly surpass these limits if pushed to far, though the strain often causes her to temporarily lose all access to her powers.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />(This is optional.)<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />
