I never have the knowledge or rather the knowledge doesn't really stay with me unless I hear it from myself. Now I suppose you want to know who I am? I'm a spirit selected to help and teach those about guiding souls through bonding and lending those my strength. But it seems I'm not at full power anymore, for some reason selecting this Spencer Kid at a young age had some... effect on my powers and skills leaving it fractured and weaken over both him and I. What I know for sure is the fact that I don't belong here, or remember how I got here along with this guy. Questions regarding that is always replied with 'I'm afraid I can't tell you that.' My current goal is to survive with this guy and restore my powers and figure out what we were looking into. But it's going to be hard since he lost more memories than I have... This is going to be a long journey."<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />*Where the parenthesis are, you replace with your own information as necessary.
