An explosion consumed him, with most believing he died. However there was a few things to note about the computer, for one its power source wasn't traditional electricity but mystical based and that when it was destroyed it passed on said mystical and technological powers to Thomas. Creating the OverClocked System. More details will be listed in the history. For now let's explain the System along with the Helix Addon.<br /><br />Formerly transformation into a "superior" form of himself would require the words: "Zero, One, Digitize." Then the phrase, "Return Zero." For him to change back. With the Helix Addon, the transformation and revert phrases had changed to, "Let's Crash This System!" and "Shutdown!" To change back.<br /><br />After transforming into the Helix Crash Form, his body become enhanced in all capabilities allowing survivability in combat. However he's still human at the end of the day too much damage can force a shutdown of the Helix system requiring a reboot of three posts.<br /><br />His inventory has been changed as well, he can hold a number of items in something similar to a pocket space like a video game character. He's able to cycle through weapons rapidly by using the term: [Virtualize: {Weapon Name}] it forces the weapons he has in combat to change letting any weapon he has scattered vanish and reappear in his inventory if they aren't destroyed, then spawn a new weapon in hand.<br /><br />However other features regarding this system is locked off/incomplete until Thomas... Or well Maxwell finds appropriate tech and fixes for this system.<br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />Thomas Oswald was a youth with a great mind, from a young age around 7. He was already experimenting with various computers with the help of his father. He picked up on various different coding languages and systems rather quickly. He was seen as a bit of a prodigy with his work. Everyday Thomas worked hard to apply himself, but it was at a cost of socializing with others for sometime. He wasn't able to interact with much with kids his age. When he did finally go to high school, he had trouble holding conversations with people... interacting with them. Usually being marked off as a weird kid. Though he made friends with two other outcasts at the time, Maxwell Ryan, [REDACTED], and Enrique Reyes.<br /><br />Though a year after starting high school, his father would bring him in to show off a Super Computer that they've discovered far out in the outskirts. <br /><br /><br />Thomas felt a voice beckoning him to access the computer, despite his father's warning about the machine Thomas went on a head to accessing everything within the machine. An explosion consumed the lab and Thomas himself. The computer seemed to be destroyed along with the boy. Or so it was believed for weeks until Thomas returned home wounded from the explosion but miraculously alive. This is where Thomas' story began and where it would mean the beginning of the end.<br /><br />The boy discovered that he had supernatural powers, powers that he'd use to fight for justice. Or rather his own interpretation of justice. That's where it went down hill. He fought against people that didn't fit his moral or belief on how the world works. He pushed against friends, to further his own way and passion on how everything should be. He did't take time to think twice about his actions at all even when his friends joined him on his battles. Maxwell becoming the Grim Reaper and Enrique Reyes, The LightSeeker. Meanwhile, the computer returned to a mysterious location simulating a copy of the world with back update based around Thomas. In that reality Data Thomas would encounter a being that would make itself known as Helix. Helix would guide him about how to use his powers. While the Real Thomas became OverClock just like Data Thomas would. Their battles mirroring one another. There was a large discrepancy in all of this. Data Thomas had Helix around to show him the way.<br /><br />While the real one grew distance from his friends and family. No limit on his powers at all, no one to tell him no. When D.T. (Data Thomas) went out of control with his abilities they were locked off by Helix. Helix would try to give him advice and show him the way, tell him to talk out his problems with friends and family. Which brought him closer to humanity and quell all doubts he had within himself temporarily.<br /><br />Two years gone by the Real Thomas eventually saw that everything he worked for naught. Crime only grew, he realize defeating criminals, putting them in prison was just a temporary fix to the infection that held his town. With a swift decision, he decided there's one cure. The name Overclock was known in his small town as a name of a hero. Soon that name would be blooded by the deaths of many of those that broke the law no matter how slight or massive the crime is. He wen't from a teen to having no power to one that held all the power. He fought intensely against Reaper (Maxwell) and Seeker (Enrique).<br /><br />During that time Helix examined the state of the battle and decided to tell Data Thomas the truth. His home, his world was a mixture of truths and lies. Everyone's behavior in the realm wasn't something that wasn't calculated. The core of the computer had a mystical power source that allows it to copy the hearts of others making the simulated world and himself more real that it ever could have been. Originally Data Thomas was reluctant to accept this fact, not wanting to face the truth that he's a false copy. All of his memories of his childhood, his parents, everything was just memories not true experiences. Helix explained to D.T. that he was meant to be a back up in case Thomas died, and that he himself was suppose to Mentor Thomas on his powers. But the computer had locked up and returned back to its original placement in [REDACTED]. He soon explains that the Real Thomas was indiscriminately killing people for the smallest crimes that its time to crash his system.<br /><br />The Data copied agree'd, as Helix would finally execute a purge of everything on the computer letting himself and D.T out to engage with the other Thomas. Soon meeting up with the other heroes of the town he explained the situation about Thomas, Helix and himself. There was a great battle with everyone teaming up against Thomas. It took multiple days, even weeks to figure out how to put him down. In the moments between battles, D.T. was able to make true friendships with Enrique and Maxwell. Maxwell confided in D.T. about his life, his experiences and that he felt like it would be better to disappear which D.T. disagreed with, explaining Maxwell was one of his dear friends... However that was short live when the real Thomas killed Maxwell. His Reaper power recompiled by Helix and sent off into the distance to someone else that would have the power to use it for good. In the last battle Thomas was defeated and sealed in the Super Computer. In memory of Maxwell and the fact that he wanted to distance himself from Thomas as his own person. He took on the name Maxwell, and with Helix by his side... He took the words Helix said to him about fighting Thomas to heart becoming Helix Crash.<br /><br />*He would protect his home for anyone that would seek to do it harm and show people the way. He knew people don't change easily but he doesn't want to make the same mistakes as Thomas. However with all the damages and craziness that happened, he wouldn't be able to stay in the town for long. Just like any other mutant or supernatural being, Maxwell was forced into Taikoku City. He fought the good fight to prevent himself and others from falling into this fate. However in the fight he lost Helix who used everything in his power to make sure Maxwell wasn't executed for his resistance. Helix was deleted that day... Maxwell was taken from his home... All the battle scars. The time he had to make amends for his other self, his real self with his family and friends. That was no longer an option that he could choose. Though he wasn't exactly directly placed in the city, he was more or less contained due to the nature of his powers and himself. A being of pure data that can act and think like a human. Everything about him didn't seem like a perfect computer it was an interesting thing nonetheless. Now for the time being he had time to think about all of his struggles, what was everything he fought for amounted to. He still lost his friends and family working to do right by people but was Thomas right? Maxwell ponders as he resigns himself to his fate... For now.<br /><br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>"For the longest time I thought I had a great life, but it was something so short lived. I was "born" fifteen years old. Helix was the one to guide me through everything. He was the safety on my powers keeping me from abusing them. I didn't know he was more apart of me then I originally thought. After Helix died... I lost a lot. Most of my powers became corrupted and incomplete making it unusable. Everything Thomas had learned, I can't seem to remember correctly... Part of my mind... my data is damaged... I have to relearn a lot of things. Grow again as a person, I guess I can't just have everything handed to me. I do want to be my own person. Separate from Thomas... I do remember a few things like codes... streams... among other things... But my intellect is not like it use to. I need my friends, I need Helix... I can't do everything alone like this. I'm not like him, I care about my friends. Now I have nothing..."</b>
