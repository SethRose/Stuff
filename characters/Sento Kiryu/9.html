Here's an example, Normally in you jump and kick someone, gravity dictates you fall to the ground immediately. However with his wind style of combat he's able to quickly turn his body in the air decreasing his descent to attack a few more times before completely descending towards the ground. There's also the ability for Sato to rush his target if he knocks them a certain distance away from himself in a quick pursuit. Here are the chains listed for his basic actions at this current level.<br /><br /><u>Air Combo Chain*</u> - Allows Sato to preform three melee actions in the air before descending to the ground.<br /><br /><u>Pursuit</u> - Currently only works on the ground: Allows Sato to quickly dash after a target after knocking them away with a hard hit. Only allows one melee action for Sato afterwards. <br /><br /><br />[Wind Combatant: Airjitzu Block Lv.1]<br />A special blocking technique that allows Sato to take one heavy hit from an enemy's attack and completely reduce the damage to normal human levels by funneling wind at the point of impact. Also reduce the damage of spells...
