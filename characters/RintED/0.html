Galin is capable of forging many items with mystical properties, namely armor, weapons, and more 'backwards' tech. Such things can be blades that are sharper than can be and never dull, rope that infinitely stretches as long as it is not cut, armor that grants water breathing, etc.<br /><br />{Blade of the Mother}<br />A soul-bound long sword is stuck with Galin. As the blade touches earth, it is capable of manipulating it with slashes and thrusts. However, he is cursed in the sky, bad luck always follows when away from the ground. Leaving the ground any longer than an hour starts to bring about scaling misfortune. The blade always seeks the ground.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=white><br />Life can suck quite a lot. Such is the life of the blacksmith of birth. From a line of smiths came a bastard, from the line of duelists came a swordsman. While learning both sides of the family can take a lot out of one, when his inner power was released, such potential, such growth to be had! Both wanted custody, both tore him apart. So alone he went, to a place his own, growing, learning, living. Such is a simply complicated life to have, making trinkets to perfect skill, making dummies to perfect form, making time to perfect living.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br />
