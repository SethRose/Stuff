A special sound-absorbent alloy and specialized cloth weaved with strands of it make up the suit, with a personal LED mask to give different expressions made of a one-way darkened glass to hide the face of Gjallarhorn. The suit is capable of allowing great focus and control of Gjallarhorn's power, while stopping it from exuding too much strength unless the fail-safe, SOUNDWAVE, is triggered.}<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>Powers/Abilities:</u><font color=white><br />{Cry of the Banshee}<br />Sophisticated acoustic powers enable Gjallarhorn to create shockwaves, pinpoint enemy positions and weak spots, suppress sounds in her surrounding environment, and even emit trembling vibrations to topple her foes.<br /><br /><font color=gray><u>Notes</u><font color=white><br />"Gjallarhorn" is her code name. No one knows her real name ever since she moved in.<br />Her suit keeps her constant acoustic resonations under control.<br />Gjallarhorn is mute, and communicates with hand gestures, her mask, and sign language.<br />The suit is about as durable as modern tech can get, sheerly to prevent damage from causing it to fail, and her power from leaking out and destroying nearby structures and harming innocents.<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
