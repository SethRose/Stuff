Why does she have so much Candy.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>Powers/Abilities:</u><font color=yellow><br />Slime Physiology:<br /><br />Her body is made up of a material that is similar to 'slime', making her almost quite immune to that of physical and blunt attacks. She is able to shift her body about in order to fix whatever need or slip into any area she needs to. But, naturally, she can make herself feel and look exactly like a normal human. She has a core in which is similar to a gel sphere, it, too, can be squished about, but once unsquished, it'll revert back into a 'sphere'. She is extremely weak to that of the elements, except for water and liquids. Hates fire, lightning, ice, etc etc. Once the core is broken, the rest of her will die away.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />She's just a normal NEET who got <I>really</I> into just hacking stuff and learning info. She's brought down a few random businesses due to corrupt management or bad health laws.</font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
