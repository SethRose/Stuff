Sarah has to initiate contact with both her hands making a super loud clap sound which makes her power not really beneficial in sneak situations unless she has done the condition before getting in to it. If her power goes a bit beyond the normal number her power that she received increases making one of her eyes color red. Also each ability will last 3 [fight posts]<br /> <br />1% a Hammer that will spawn on top of her head and fall down for bad gamble luck she can get a 20% higher power in exchange for letting the hammer slam in to her toe breaking one of her toes after the second time she reaches 1%. <br /><br />2-5% a hand gun. 6% Her hand gun gets an auto function to allow her to shoot her gun as if it was a machine gun.<br /><br />Sarah's power stays with her for 3 fight posts and after the hand clasp she will see a number out of 1 to a 100.<br /><br />10% Earth Manipulation: 11-19% Earth Manipulation of Enhanced Levels<br /><br />20% Hair manipulation: Sarah can manipulate her hair as if they were vines or clothes strings and tie stuff or make her hair grow to any size. Her hair also becomes as strong as  titanium. 25%-30 Her Hair mostly stays the same but she gets the ability to put her hair on fire.<br /><br />30% God's Hand. Sarah's hands will be cloaked in a white enhanced aura protecting her hand while once in contact with a threat the hand will sense ill intent and immediately slap the threat or even weapons. Her hands will slap even weapons with the aura coating her hands as protection once a slap is landed it will follow with another combo of a second slap coming of to the touched spot giving a wind pressure slap landing 2 enhanced hits by default upon the first touch. <br /><br />35% = At this point Sarah can actually use the ability at will but also create a physical giant hand out of a shape aura that slaps when she moves her hands. This giant hand will deal the same amount of damage but more around the body because it be a giant aura shaped hand but this will leave her real hands unprotected once she makes those aura big hands close to her.<br /><br />40% Sarah can gain wings to fly that are strong enough to create a small whirlwind just by flapping the strong wings. The whirlwinds are strong enough to to toss a car or a medium sized tree 45% She can emit a bright light from her body and shoot lasers of light that are obviously not *cough* not light speed* Basically she is the angel of light.<br /><br />50% Animal Gains: Sarah gains beer claws or lion claws and animal senses to feel incoming danger or even smell people like a dog. She gets all the needed anime traits for the hunt and for close combat. She can also go ahead and talk to animals now. 55% Her body can go in to a sleep that slowly recovers her body from wounds. <br /><br />60% Sarah can throw talisman on items locking them stuck in one place or control a object or maybe even an animal. at 65% Sarah gets the power to even turn her talishman in to fire and set them ablaze in a big burst of fire that can give heavy burns once it connects to the user.<br /><br />70% Sarah can create weather in one specific area around here of 20 meter range and this gives her the ability to make blizzards of snow to push somebody back make it rain hard or even snow normally or rain normally. She can also create the clouds for of course thunder moving at an enhanced speed towards someone from above. Sarah can however also feel the cold of the area or heat just a bit less then her opponent and the thunder can go out of control the second time she uses it and shock her too. Either that or she will control it Coin flip. Tails= control/Heads= gets hit by her own thunder which will be a gamble each time after she performs a controlled thunder strike.  75% Sarah has build resistance to the weather environment and can use thunder strikes without risk of getting hit herself.<br /><br />80% gets a dragon fire breath.<br /><br />85% Her fire breath can become icy and freeze stuff instead of heat.<br /><br />90% Super human Strenght<br /><br />100% = Super Human Strenght + Enhanced Armor with claws on it making her body mostly enhanced in the aspects besides her strenght.<br /><br />Second power: Healing: Basically just simple healing that she can't use on her self and it drains her own stamina if the wounds are to deep it can basically make her pass out.<br /><br />Skills: <br />Mixed Martial Arts<br /><br />Peak Human<br /><br /><br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=aqua><br />Wip<br /></font color><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />
