In Eterunetsu's case, it's parents were also dragons too. Weird right? It's traits may spread a bit thin because of the three different races though, and it will, but very rarely, have very brief convulsions due to it being so diverse, showing that it is all three, and it does look very burdening at times. When it does have convulsions, it's about the same reaction as being electrocuted, but it will only hurt Eterunetsu a little because of the quick twitching motions. It can somewhat retract most of the skinnier and thinner spikes, like the ones on it's tail and arms, and can just barely protrude a smaller sized spikes somewhere along it's body if need be. All these spikes 'do not' create a blind spot for the creature, and it can somewhat move most of them, like if it's horns get in the way of it's shoulder spikes, one or the other, or both will shift or bend to compensate.<br /><br /><font color=white><i>Resistances</i></font color><br />Resistance ratings are based on a 5 star system for how strong they are against each element (1-5; 1 = very strong, 2 = strong, 3 = normal, 4 weak, 5 = very weak).<br /><br /><b>Blunt Forces</b><br />2<br /><b>Sharp Forces</b><br />4<br /><b>Fire</b><br />1<br /><b>Electricity</b><br />2 if touching the ground, 4 if not.<br /><b>Ice & Water</b><br />3<br /><b>Earth</b><br />3<br /><b>Magic</b><br />3<br /><b>Holy and Unholy</b><br />4 from other forces and opposite to affinity (holy vs unholy or unholy vs holy). 2 if the same affinity hits the same affinity (holy vs holy or unholy vs unholy).)<br /><br /><font color=white><i>Physical Attributes</i></font color><br />Ratings are based on a 7 star system for each tier (Lowest percentile="---", Lower="--", Low="-", Average" ", High="+", Higher="++", Highest="+++").<br /><br /><b>Speed</b><br />(Enhanced++)<br /><b>Agility</b><br />(Superhuman---)<br /><b>Strength</b><br />(Enhanced++)<br /><b>Stamina</b><br />(Enhanced+++)<br /><b>Durability</b><br />(Superhuman---)<br /><br />Speed and Durability start to switch when spikes start to retract, and well fully retracted, stats are fully switched.<br /><br /><font color=white><i>Profile</i></font color><br />Height: 10'<br />Weight: 847 lbs.<br />1 Wing's Span: 8'4''<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>Other:</u><font color=yellow><br />It can go a very, very long time without eating usually, but it doesn't have a specific diet either. It's scales under it's fur are very durable and rather flame proof, even rivaling some metals, but sharper objects can still pierce through with enough force. It has about around a 1 1/2 inch length of fur all along it's body that isn't it's horns, spikes, or underbelly. It is also surprisingly light despite it's size, and armor, which is probably why it's so fast in the first place. It has multiple hearts (two) like elongated dragons do; there is one on each side in the chest region like where a heart should naturally be, but on both sides instead of only just the left or right. Only one heart beats though; the one on the angelic side. It also might have some kind of multiple personality disorder that only has two or three sides. Sometimes when it speaks, the voice might sound calm and soothing (angelic), or aggressive and rough (demonic). Other times it will sound like both of these voices are talking in unison, but this is much less often. It is very rare for it to be seen sleeping, but is very common to just see it resting if it's not doing anything. They are also strangely flexible. It's eyes glow somewhat in the dark.<br /></font color><br /><font color=gray><u>History:</u><font color=yellow><br />(This is optional.)<br /></font color></td></tr></tbody></table><br />*Where the parenthesis are, you replace with your own information as necessary.
