# Beyond
A chat program for roleplaying, to support multiple characters, actions, and expressions.

Set up is fairly simple (though it will require node and npm to work); just:

* [`Install node.js with npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Make sure your port of choice is forwarded for TCP/UDP
* Put the files in a folder
* Navigate to that folder with your command line ('cd C:\Users\[yourname]\Beyond' for instance)
* Use 'npm install' in the command line to acquire the needed node modules (I do my best to keep this list small)
* Use 'node index.js [portnumber]' to start the server (0 or no number for a random port)
* Access the server with any modern browser using the IP address and port.

The server will make all other needed files for saving and management in the folder itself.
